dt
abductive reasoning
dd
Also abduction.
dt
abductive reasoning
dd
A form of logical inference which starts with an observation or set of observations then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. This process, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it.[1] abductive inference,[1] or retroduction[2]
dt
abstract data type
dd
A mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.

An area of machine learning concerned with creation and modification of software agent's knowledge about effects and preconditions of the actions that can be executed within its environment. This knowledge is usually represented in logic-based action description language and used as the input for automated planners.

adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
dd
A kind of artificial neural network that is based on Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference system. The technique was developed in the early 1990s.[6][7] Since it integrates both neural networks and fuzzy logic principles, it has potential to capture the benefits of both in a single framework. Its inference system corresponds to a set of fuzzy IF–THEN rules that have learning capability to approximate nonlinear functions.[8] Hence, ANFIS is considered to be a universal estimator.[9] For using the ANFIS in a more efficient and optimal way, one can use the best parameters obtained by genetic algorithm.[10][11]

answer set programming (ASP)
dd
A form of declarative programming oriented towards difficult (primarily NP-hard) search problems. It is based on the stable model (answer set) semantics of logic programming.

An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.

argumentation framework
dd
A way to deal with contentious information and draw conclusions from it. In an abstract argumentation framework,[24] entry-level information is a set of abstract arguments that, for instance, represent data or a proposition. Conflicts between arguments are represented by a binary relation on the set of arguments. In concrete terms, you represent an argumentation framework with a directed graph such that the nodes are the arguments, and the arrows represent the attack relation. There exist some extensions of the Dung's framework, like the logic-based argumentation frameworks[25] or the value-based argumentation frameworks.[26]
