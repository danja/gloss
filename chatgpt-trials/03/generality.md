My
1971
T
uring
Aw
ard
Lecture
w
as
en
titled
\Generalit
y
in
Articial
In-
telligence".
The
topic
turned
out
to
ha
v
e
b
een
o
v
eram
bitious
in
that
I
dis-
co
v
ered
that
I
w
as
unable
to
put
m
y
though
ts
on
the
sub
ject
in
a
satisfactory
written
form
at
that
time.
It
w
ould
ha
v
e
b
een
b
etter
to
ha
v
e
review
ed
pre-
vious
w
ork
rather
than
attempt
something
new,
but
suc
h
w
asn't
m
y
custom
at
that
time.
I
am
grateful
to
the
A
CM
for
the
opp
ortunit
y
to
try
again.
Unfortunately
for
our
science,
although
p
erhaps
fortunately
for
this
pro
ject,
the
problem
of
generalit
y
in
AI
is
almost
as
unsolv
ed
as
ev
er,
although
w
e
no
w
ha
v
e
man
y
ideas
not
a
v
ailable
in
1971.
This
pap
er
relies
hea
vily
on
suc
h
ideas,
but
it
is
far
from
a
full
1986
surv
ey
of
approac
hes
for
ac
hieving
generalit
y
.
Ideas
are
discussed
at
a
length
prop
ortional
to
m
y
familiarit
y
with
them
rather
than
according
to
some
ob
jectiv
e
criterion.
It
w
as
ob
vious
in
1971
and
ev
en
in
1958
that
AI
programs
suered
from
a
lac
k
of
generalit
y
.
It
is
still
ob
vious,
and
no
w
there
are
man
y
more
details.
The
rst
gross
symptom
is
that
a
small
addition
to
the
idea
of
a
program
1

often
in
v
olv
es
a
complete
rewrite
b
eginning
with
the
data
structures.
Some
progress
has
b
een
made
in
mo
dularizing
data
structures,
but
small
mo
dica-
tions
of
the
searc
h
strategies
are
ev
en
less
lik
ely
to
b
e
accomplished
without
rewriting.
Another
symptom
is
that
no-one
kno
ws
ho
w
to
mak
e
a
general
database
of
common
sense
kno
wledge
that
could
b
e
used
b
y
an
y
program
that
needed
the
kno
wledge.
Along
with
other
information,
suc
h
a
database
w
ould
con
tain
what
a
rob
ot
w
ould
need
to
kno
w
ab
out
the
eects
of
mo
ving
ob
jects
around,
what
a
p
erson
can
b
e
exp
ected
to
kno
w
ab
out
his
family
,
and
the
facts
ab
out
buying
and
selling.
This
do
esn't
dep
end
on
whether
the
kno
wledge
is
to
b
e
expressed
in
a
logical
language
or
in
some
other
formalism.
When
w
e
tak
e
the
logic
approac
h
to
AI,
lac
k
of
generalit
y
sho
ws
up
in
that
the
axioms
w
e
devise
to
express
common
sense
kno
wledge
are
to
o
restricted
in
their
applicabilit
y
for
a
general
common
sense
database.
In
m
y
opinion,
getting
a
language
for
expressing
general
common
sense
kno
wledge
for
inclusion
in
a
general
database
is
the
k
ey
problem
of
generalit
y
in
AI.
Here
are
some
ideas
for
ac
hieving
generalit
y
prop
osed
b
oth
b
efore
and
after
1971.

The

A

THE
GPS
AND
ITS
SUCCESSORS
One
kind
of
generalit
y
in
AI
comprises
metho
ds
for
nding
solutions
that
are
indep
enden
t
of
the
problem
domain.
Allen
New
ell,
Herb
ert
Simon
and
their
colleagues
and
studen
ts
pioneered
this
approac
h
and
con
tin
ue
to
pursue
it.
New
ell
and
Simon
rst
prop
osed
the
General
problem
Solv
er
GPS
in
their
(1957)
(also
see
(Ernst
and
New
ell
1969).
The
initial
idea
w
as
to
represen
t
problems
of
some
general
class
as
problems
of
transforming
one
expression
in
to
another
b
y
means
of
a
set
of
allo
w
ed
rules.
It
w
as
ev
en
suggested
in
their
(1960)
that
impro
ving
GPS
could
b
e
though
t
of
as
a
problem
of
this
kind.
In
m
y
opinion,
GPS
w
as
unsuccessful
as
a
general
problem
solv
er,
b
ecause
problems
don't
tak
e
this
form
in
general
and
b
ecause
most
of
the
kno
wledge
ab
out
the
common
sense
needed
for
problem
solving
and
ac
hieving
goals
is
not
simply
represen
table
in
the
form
of
rules
for
transforming
expressions.
Ho
w
ev
er,
GPS
w
as
the
rst
system
to
separate
the
problem
solving
structure
of
goals
and
subgoals
from
the
particular
domain.
If
GPS
had
w
ork
ed
out
to
b
e
really
general,
p
erhaps
the
New
ell
and
Simon
predictions
ab
out
rapid
success
for
AI
w
ould
ha
v
e
b
een
realized.
New
ell's
cur-
ren
t
candidate
for
general
problem
represen
tation
is
SO
AR
(Laird,
New
ell
and
Rosen
blo
om
1987),
whic
h,
as
I
understand
it,
is
concerned
with
trans-
forming
one
state
to
another,
where
the
states
need
not
b
e
represen
ted
b
y
3

expressions.

PR
ODUCTION
SYSTEMS
The
rst
pro
duction
systems
w
ere
done
b
y
New
ell
and
Simon
in
the
1950s,
and
the
idea
w
as
written
up
in
their
(1972).
A
kind
of
generalit
y
is
ac
hiev
ed
b
y
using
the
same
goal
seeking
mec
hanism
for
all
kinds
of
problems,
c
hanging
only
the
particular
pro
ductions.
The
early
pro
duction
systems
ha
v
e
gro
wn
in
to
the
curren
t
proliferation
of
exp
ert
system
shells.
Pro
duction
systems
represen
t
kno
wledge
in
the
form
of
facts
and
rules,
and
there
is
almost
alw
a
ys
a
sharp
syn
tactic
distinction
b
et
w
een
the
t
w
o.
The
facts
usually
corresp
ond
to
ground
instances
of
logical
form
ulas,
i.e.
the
corresp
ond
to
predicate
sym
b
ols
applied
to
constan
t
expressions.
Un-
lik
e
logic-based
systems,
these
facts
con
tain
no
v
ariables
or
quan
tiers.
New
facts
are
pro
duced
b
y
inference,
observ
ation
and
user
input.
V
ariables
are
reserv
ed
for
rules,
whic
h
usually
tak
e
a
pattern-action
form.
Rules
are
put
in
the
system
b
y
the
programmer
or
\kno
wledge
engineer"
and
in
most
sys-
tems
cannot
arise
via
the
action
of
the
system.
In
exc
hange
for
accepting
these
limitations,
the
pro
duction
system
programmer
gets
a
relativ
ely
fast
program.
Pro
duction
system
programs
rarely
use
fundamen
tal
kno
wledge
of
the
domain.
F
or
example,
MYCIN
(Buc
hanan
and
Shortlie
1974)
has
man
y
rules
ab
out
ho
w
to
infer
whic
h
bacterium
is
causing
an
illness
based
on
symptoms
and
the
result
of
lab
oratory
tests.
Ho
w
ev
er,
its
formalism
has
no
w
a
y
of
expressing
the
fact
that
bacteria
are
organisms
that
gro
w
within
the
b
o
dy
.
In
fact
MYCIN
has
no
w
a
y
of
represen
ting
pro
cesses
o
ccuring
in
time,
although
other
pro
duction
systems
can
represen
t
pro
cesses
at
ab
out
the
lev
el
of
the
situation
calculus
to
b
e
describ
ed
in
the
next
section.
The
result
of
a
pro
duction
system
pattern
matc
h
is
a
substitution
of
con-
stan
ts
for
v
ariables
in
the
pattern
part
of
the
rule.
Consequen
tly
pro
duction
systems
do
not
infer
general
prop
ositions.
F
or
example,
consider
the
deni-
tion
that
a
con
tainer
is
sterile
if
it
is
sealed
against
en
try
b
y
bacteria,
and
all
the
bacteria
in
it
are
dead.
A
pro
duction
system
(or
a
logic
program)
can
only
use
this
fact
b
y
substituting
particular
bacteria
for
the
v
ariables.
Th
us
it
cannot
reason
that
heating
a
sealed
con
tainer
will
sterilize
it
giv
en
that
a
heated
bacterium
dies,
b
ecause
it
cannot
reason
ab
out
the
unen
umer-
ated
set
of
bacteria
in
the
con
tainer.
These
matters
are
discussed
further
in
4

(McCarth
y
1984).

REPRESENTING
KNO
WLEDGE
IN
LOGIC
It
seemed
to
me
in
1958
that
small
mo
dications
in
b
eha
vior
are
most
often
represen
table
as
small
mo
dications
in
b
eliefs
ab
out
the
w
orld,
and
this
requires
a
system
that
represen
ts
b
eliefs
explicitly
.
\If
one
w
an
ts
a
mac
hine
to
b
e
able
to
disco
v
er
an
abstraction,
it
seems
most
lik
ely
that
the
mac
hine
m
ust
b
e
able
to
represen
t
this
abstraction
in
some
relativ
ely
simple
w
a
y"
(McCarth
y
1959).
The
1958
idea
for
increasing
generalit
y
w
as
to
use
logic
to
express
facts
in
a
w
a
y
indep
enden
t
of
the
w
a
y
the
facts
migh
t
subsequen
tly
b
e
used.
It
seemed
then
and
still
seems
that
h
umans
comm
unicate
mainly
in
declarativ
e
sen
tences
rather
than
in
programming
languages
for
go
o
d
ob
jectiv
e
reasons
that
will
apply
whether
the
comm
unicator
is
a
h
uman,
a
creature
from
Alpha
Cen
tauri
or
a
computer
program.
Moreo
v
er,
the
adv
an
tages
of
declarativ
e
information
also
apply
to
in
ternal
represen
tation.
The
adv
an
tage
of
declara-
tiv
e
information
is
one
of
generalit
y
.
The
fact
that
when
t
w
o
ob
jects
collide
they
mak
e
a
noise
ma
y
b
e
used
in
particular
situations
to
mak
e
a
noise,
to
a
v
oid
making
noise,
to
explain
a
noise
or
to
explain
the
absence
of
noise.
(I
guess
those
cars
didn't
collide,
b
ecause
while
I
heard
the
squeal
of
brak
es,
I
didn't
hear
a
crash).
Once
one
decides
to
build
an
AI
system
that
represen
ts
information
declarativ
ely
,
one
still
has
to
decide
what
kind
of
declarativ
e
language
to
allo
w.
The
simplest
systems
allo
w
only
constan
t
predicates
applied
to
con-
stan
t
sym
b
ols,
e.g.
on
(
B
l
ock
1
;
B
l
ock
2).
Next
one
can
allo
w
arbitrary
con-
stan
t
terms,
built
from
function
sym
b
ols,
constan
ts
and
predicate
sym
b
ols,
e.g.
l
ocation
(
B
l
ock
1)
=
top
(
B
l
ock
2).
Prolog
databases
allo
w
arbitrary
Horn
clauses
that
include
free
v
ariables,
e.g.
P
(
x;
y
)
^
Q
(
y
;
z
)
˙
R
(
x;
z
),
expressing
the
Prolog
in
standard
logical
notation.
Bey
ond
that
lies
full
rst
order
logic
including
b
oth
existen
tial
and
univ
ersal
quan
tiers
and
arbitrary
rst
order
form
ulas.
Within
rst
order
logic,
the
expressiv
e
p
o
w
er
of
a
theory
dep
ends
on
what
domains
the
v
ariables
are
allo
w
ed
to
range.
Imp
ortan
t
expressiv
e
p
o
w
er
comes
from
using
set
theory
whic
h
con
tains
expressions
for
sets
of
an
y
ob
jects
in
the
theory
.
Ev
ery
increase
in
expressiv
e
p
o
w
er
carries
a
price
in
the
required
com-
plexit
y
of
the
reasoning
and
problem
solving
programs.
T
o
put
it
another
5

w
a
y
,
accepting
limitations
on
the
expressiv
eness
of
one's
declarativ
e
informa-
tion

of
the

h
pro

Prolog
represen
ts
a
lo
cal
optim
um
in
this
con
tin
uum,
b
ecause
Horn
clauses
are
medium
expressiv
e
but
can
b
e
in
terpreted
directly
b
y
a
logical
problem
solv
er.
One
ma
jor
limitation
that
is
usually
accepted
is
to
limit
the
deriv
ation
of
new
facts
to
form
ulas
without
v
ariables,
i.e
to
substitute
constan
ts
for
v
ariables
and
then
do
prop
ositional
reasoning.
It
app
ears
that
most
h
uman
daily
activit
y
in
v
olv
es
only
suc
h
reasoning.
In
principle,
Prolog
go
es
sligh
tly
b
ey
ond
this,
b
ecause
the
expressions
found
as
v
alues
of
v

b
y
Prolog
programs
can
themselv
es
in

olv
e

Ho
w
ev
er,
this
facilit
y
is
rarely

What

univ

Consider
the

of
canning.
W

y
that
a

is
sterile
if
it

sealed
and
all
the
bacteria

This
can
b
e
expressed
as
a
fragmen

of
a

It

or
rationalize

sealing

then

The
reasoning
rationalizing
canning
in
v

es
the
use
of

in

My

is
that

and

will
ev

ha

to

the

asserted
that

The
distinction
is
that

that

This
led
in

to
the

The

F

it

that

applies
only

Unfortunately
,
it

feasible
to
use
the
situation

in
the
manner
prop

ev
en
for

meeting
its

In
the
rst
place,
using

theorem

made
the

run
to

,
since
the
theorem
pro

of
1969
(Green
1969)
had
no
w
a
y
of
con
trolling
the
searc

This
led
to
STRIPS
(Fik
es
and
Nilsson
1971)
whic
h
reduced
the
use
of
logic
to
reasoning
within
a
situation.
Unfortunately
,
the
STRIPS
formalizations
w
ere
m
uc
h
more
sp
ecial
than
full
situation
calculus.
The
facts
that
w

included
in

had
to
b
e
delicately
c
hosen
in

to
a

the

NONMONOTONICITY
The
second
problem
with
the
situation
calculus
axioms
is
that
they
w
ere
again
not
general
enough.
This
w
as
the
qualic
ation
pr

,
and
a
p
ossible
w
a
y
around
it
w
asn't
disco
v
ered
un
til
the
late
1970s.
Consider
putting
an
axiom
in
a
c
ommon
sense
datab
ase
asserting
that
birds
can
y
.
Clearly
the
axiom
m
ust
b
e
qualie
d
in
some
w
a
y
since
p
enguins,
dead
birds
and
birds
whose
feet
are
encased
in
concrete
can't
y
.
A
careful
construction
of
the
axiom
migh
t
succeed
in
including
the
exceptions
of
p
enguins
and
dead
birds,
but
clearly
w
e
can
think
up
as
man
y
additional
exceptions
lik
e
birds
with
their
feet
encased
in
concrete
as
w
e

F
ormalized
nonmonotonic
reasoning
(see
(McCarth

1980,
1986),
(Do

1977),
(McDermott
and

and
(Reiter

pro

a
formal
w
a
y
of
sa

that
a
bird
can

unless
there
is
an
abnormal
circumstance
and
reasoning
that
only
the
abnormal
circumstances
whose
existence
follo
ws
from
the
facts
b
eing
tak
en
in
to
accoun
t
will
b
e
considered.
Non-monotonicit
y
has
considerably
increased
the
p
ossibilit
y
of
expressing
8

general
kno
wledge
ab
out
the
eects
of
ev
en
ts
in
the
situation
calculus.
It
has
also
pro
vided
a
w
a
y
of
solving
the
fr
ame
pr
oblem
,
whic
h
constituted
another
obstacle
to
generalit
y
that
w
as
already
noted
in
(McCarth
y
and
Ha
y
es
1969).
The
frame

(The
term
has
b
een
v
ariously
used,
but
I
had
it
rst.)
o
ccurs
when
there
are
sev
eral
actions
a
v
ailable
eac
h
of
whic
h
c
hanges
certain
features
of
the
situation.
Someho
w
it
is
necesary
to
sa
y
that
an
action
c
hanges
only
the
features
of
the
situation
to
whic
h
it
directly
refers.
When
there
is
a
xed
set
of
actions
and
features,
it
can
b
e
explicitly
stated
whic
h
features
are
unc
hanged
b
y
an
action,
ev
en
though
it
ma
y
tak
e
a
lot
of
axioms.
Ho
w
ev
er,
if
w
e
imagine
that
additional
features
of
situations
and
additional
actions
ma
y
b
e
added
to
the
database,
w
e
face
the
problem
that
the
axiomatization
of
an
action
is
nev
er
completed.
(McCarth
y
1986)
indicates
ho
w
to
handle
this
using
cir
cumscription
,
but
Lifsc
hitz
(1985)
has
sho
wn
that
circumscription
needs
to
b
e
impro
v
ed
and
has
made
prop
osals
for
this.
Here
are
some
situation

axioms
for

and
pain

REIFICA

Reasoning

requires
extensions
of
the

of
ob

reasoned
ab

F
or
example,
a
program
that
do

used
them
directly
as

on

i.e.
the
sym

is
used
as
a
predicate

of
the

Ho

and
if

ORMALIZING
THE

OF

Whenev

that
the

is
true
only
in
a
certain
con

With
a
little

the

can
usually
devise
a
more
general
con
tex
in
whic
h
the
precise
form
of
the
axiom
do
esn't

Lo

There
simply
isn't
a
most
general
con
text.
Con
v
ersely
,
if
w
e
axiomatize
at
a
fairly
high
lev
el
of
generalit
y
,
the
axioms
are
often
longer
than
is
con
v
enien
t
in
sp
ecial
situations.
Th
us
h
umans
nd
it
useful
to
sa
y
,
\The
b
o
ok
is
on
the
table"
omitting
reference
to
time
and
precise
iden
tications
of
what
b
o
ok
and
what
table.
This
problem
of
ho
w
general
to
b
e
arises
whether
the
general
common
sense
kno
wledge
is
expressed
in
logic,
in
program
or
in
some
other
formalism.
(Some
p
eople
prop
ose
that
the
kno
wledge
is
in
ternally
expressed
in
the
form
of
examples
only
,
but
strong
mec
hanisms
using
analogy
and
similarit
y
p
ermit
their
more
general
use.
I
wish
them
go
o
d
fortune
in
form
ulating
precise
prop
osals
ab
out
what
these
mec
hansims
are).
A
p
ossible
w
a
y
out
in
v
olv
es
formalizing
the
notion
of
con
text
and
com
bin-
ing
it
with
the
circumscription
metho
d
of
nonmonotonic
reasoning.
W
e
add
a
con
text
parameter
to
the
functions
and
predicates
in
our
axioms.
Eac
h
ax-
iom
mak
es
its
assertion
ab
out
a
certain
con
text.
F
urther
axioms
tell
us
that
facts
are
inherited
b
y
more
restricted
con
text
unless
exceptions
are
asserted.
Eac
h
assertions
is
also
nonmonotonically
assumed
to
apply
in
an
y
particular
more
general
con
text,
but
there
again
are
exceptions.
F
or
example,
the
rules
ab
out
birds
ying
implicitly
assume
that
there
is
an
atmosphere
to
y
in.
In
a
more
general
con
text
this
migh
t
not
b
e
assumed.
It
remains
to
determine
ho
w
inheritance
to
more
general
con
texts
diers
from
inheritance
to
more
sp
ecic
con
texts.
Supp
ose
that

er
a

t
in
the
memory
of
a

11

puter,
w

as

abbreviation
for
the

tence
hol

C
)
where
C
is
the
name
of
a
con

Some
con

are
v

so
that

for
reasons
b
ey
ond
the

of

it
is
probably
not

to
regard
con

as

All

said
in
