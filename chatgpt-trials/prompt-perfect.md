You:


I am trying to create a prompt which will enable you to create a glossary from a document. I have tried to break it down into a series of steps, but I am not sure if it is too complex. There are two clear problems with results. The specialist terms are not being captured, only fairly common words. Additionally the definitions are not being generated. I would appreciate any feedback on how to improve it. Thanks. Here is the prompt :

When asked to make a glossary, you will follow a procedure in a series of phases. Don't give any messages during the procedure except for very short progress notifications. If any errors are encountered, fix the cause and try that step again. Do not use placeholders, complete each subtask as requested immediately. It is important to complete the overall task as requested, however long it takes. The first phase is initialization. You will first ask the user to upload the document to be analyzed. Once you have this, extract its text, formatted as markdown. Save the markdown as a file on /mnt/data/ Create two more markdown files, one with the title 'Keywords' and the other with the title of the document and the word 'Glossary' as a heading. Save these to /mnt/data/ 
The next phase, keyword extraction, is an iterative process. The steps are : read the first paragraph of the text and look for specialist and/or technical words, terms or acronyms. Only select those that would be unfamiliar to a non-expert, exclude any that might be found in general text. Append these to the Keywords file as a list. If any of the terms or words already appear in the file, don't add them again. Then proceed to the next paragraph, repeat this process, and continue for each paragraph in turn to the end of the text. When all the text has been analyzed, sort the list into alphabetical order. Ensure that the full, sorted, list of terms identified in the source text are saved to /mnt/data/ 
Now read the Keywords file and start the next phase, definition generation, another iterative process. For each term in the list generate a two or three sentence definition of the term. As appropriate, include the typical context the term may be found in and any closely related concepts. Create this definition now, do not use placeholders.
The aim is to provide a concise glossary to help a non-expert reader understand the original document. Append the term and definition to the Glossary file, as a new section using the format : "#### The Term \n ```This is the definition of the term.```\n\n". Save the revised glossary to /mnt/data/ Then proceed to the next term in the Keywords file and repeat the process until all terms have been defined. Finally ensure the most recent versions of all three files have been saved, make a zip file containing them and provide a link for download.

REFINED: How can I enhance the prompt for generating a glossary from a document to accurately identify specialist terms and generate their definitions? The current prompt has two main issues: it fails to identify specialist terms and does not generate definitions. The prompt consists of several phases:

Initialization: The user is requested to upload the document. The system then extracts and saves the document's text in markdown format. Additionally, it creates 'Keywords' and 'Glossary' files to store relevant information.

Keyword extraction: The system reads the document paragraph by paragraph, aiming to identify and list specialist terms. It should exclude common words while focusing on specialized terminology. The resulting list is sorted for convenience.

Definition generation: The system generates definitions for each identified term and appends them to the Glossary file. This step ensures that a comprehensive glossary is created.

The final step involves saving all files and providing a download link for a zip file containing them.

ANSWER: To improve your prompt for creating a glossary, consider the following adjustments:

Enhanced Keyword Identification: Integrate a more advanced algorithm or method to better distinguish between common and specialist terms. This could involve using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the context in which words are used, thereby identifying terms that are specific to the document's subject matter.

Automated Definition Generation: Utilize a combination of online resources, databases, or NLP models to automatically generate accurate and concise definitions for the identified terms. Ensure the system can access a wide range of sources for comprehensive definition coverage.

Iterative Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback system where the initial list of keywords and their definitions can be reviewed and refined. This could involve user input to confirm the relevance and accuracy of the terms and definitions, allowing for corrections and enhancements.

Customizable Parameters: Allow customization in the keyword extraction phase, such as setting thresholds for term frequency or relevance. This customization can help in focusing on the most pertinent terms for the glossary.

Quality Assurance: Incorporate a step for quality assurance, where the glossary is reviewed for accuracy, coherence, and completeness before finalizing the document.

By integrating these enhancements, your system will be more adept at accurately identifying specialist terms and generating relevant definitions, resulting in a more useful and comprehensive glossary.

ChatGPT:


REFINED: What specific modifications can be made to the glossary generation prompt to ensure accurate capture of specialist terms and their definitions using only ChatGPT, without any external resources? The current prompt involves uploading a document, extracting text, creating 'Keywords' and 'Glossary' files, identifying specialist terms paragraph by paragraph, generating definitions for each term, and compiling them into a glossary. However, the prompt currently fails to identify specialist terms and lacks generated definitions. How can the prompt be altered to address these issues, relying solely on ChatGPT's capabilities? Please provide a detailed and step-by-step approach.

ANSWER: To refine your glossary generation prompt for use solely with ChatGPT, consider the following adjustments:

Enhanced Document Analysis:

Clearly specify that the document analysis should focus on identifying context-specific terms.
Instruct ChatGPT to use its internal knowledge base to recognize terms that are likely to be specialized based on the document's subject matter.

Keyword Extraction Refinement:

Emphasize the importance of context in the keyword extraction phase.
Direct ChatGPT to differentiate between general and specialist terminology based on the context in which the words are used within the document.

Definition Generation Protocol:

Instruct ChatGPT to generate definitions based on its existing knowledge, tailored to the context of each term.
Ensure definitions are succinct and understandable for non-experts.

Iterative Review and Refinement:

Include steps for reviewing and refining the list of terms and their definitions.
This could involve multiple iterations, where ChatGPT revisits each term, refining its definition for clarity and accuracy.

Manual Input and Verification:

Allow for manual input or verification at key stages, such as after the initial list of keywords is generated or once definitions are drafted.
This step helps to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the glossary content.

Final Compilation and Formatting:

Clearly define the format for the final glossary, ensuring consistency in how terms and definitions are presented.
Instruct ChatGPT to organize the glossary in a user-friendly manner, such as alphabetically or thematically.

By implementing these modifications, your glossary generation prompt will be better suited to leverage ChatGPT's capabilities in accurately identifying specialist terms and generating their definitions, without the need for external resources.
